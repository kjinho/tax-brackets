            <p>
                There are several common misconceptions about 
                the federal income tax system in the United States:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Having income at a certain tax bracket 
                        means that your entire income is taxed at 
                        that tax bracket.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Stepping up into the next tax bracket 
                        can result in a much higher income tax 
                        and therefore a lower net income.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Both of these misconceptions are false. This 
                calculator attempts to illustrate how and why.
            </p>
            <p>
                Federal income tax is "progressive,"
                meaning that the tax rate is higher 
                for higher levels of income. 
                In other words, the federal government 
                taxes higher income at higher rates.
                To implement this progressive tax, 
                the federal government publishes 
                a set of tax brackets. For example, 
                the tax brackets for tax year 2023 
                are as follows:
                <div class="container">
                    <div id="taxdata"></div>
                </div>
                Notably, <em>the tax rate only 
                    applies to the income within each 
                    range.</em>
                In other words, if a taxpayer's taxable income 
                is $40,000, the taxpayer only pays 
                the 12% tax rate on their taxable income from 
                $11,001 to $40,000. The remaining $11,000
                of their income is taxed at the lower 
                tax rate of 10%. Consequently, the total 
                federal income tax that the taxpayer 
                owes is only $4,580, which is approximately
                11.5% of their total taxable income of $40,000.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even better for the taxpayer, not all of 
                their income is taxable. The tax law 
                allows certain deductions to reduce a taxpayer's 
                taxable income. For most taxpayers, the so-called 
                "standard deduction" is both the easiest and largest 
                available deduction to their taxable income. 
                For tax year 2023, the standard deduction is 
                $13,850. For most taxpayers, that means they can
                subtract $13,850 from their total income before they 
                start applying the tax rates from the tax brackets.
                For the example above, the taxpayer would be able 
                to have a total income of $53,850 yet <em>still 
                    be taxed only on $40,000 of their income</em>
                because of the standard deduction. Consequently,
                their federal income tax of $4,580 is only 
                approximately 8.5% of their total income. This 
                8.5% is the so-called "effective" tax rate.
            </p>

                A progressive tax system like this results in a 
                much lower tax burden that most taxpayers expect. 
                Unfortunately, the amount of math it takes to 
                understand how much your taxes are results in the 
                misconceptions stated above.

                To ease this problem, you can use the form below 
                to estimate your federal income tax and effective 
                tax rate. To keep things simple, the form uses 
                the tax rates for a single filer using the standard 
                deduction. Married people filing jointly, people with 
                significant itemized deductions, people able to 
                take advantage of tax credits (such as the 
                earned income credit, child tax credit, etc.) may 
                owe even less in taxes and have an even lower effective 
                tax rate.
